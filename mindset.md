# Mindset

Before starting on the CV and preparation for the actual interview, you have to answer a few questions to yourself. It's just for you, but I still suggest writing it down (writing helps remembering it).

1. Why do you want/need to get the job?
2. Why do you want/neet to change the current job?
3. Is job everything for you, or is it just a means to live? Is it "work for the living" or "live for the work"?
4. Where do you see yourself in 5 years? It might sound clich√©. But, what's your plan for life, longterm dreams?
5. Where do you see yourself in a year, two, ten?
6. What do you expect from the new job?

Take a break. Let those questions sink in, sleep a day, come back to them tomorrow, day after tomorrow or whevener you're ready.
