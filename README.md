# Recruitment notes

This is a collection of notes for approaching a recruitment process.

Getting ready for a job interview might seem like a dance with a complex figures. It is. But don't worry. You can practice with friends or family, make sure that you and your CV is prepared as much as you can. There's just one secret ingredient. Chillout. Does the interview really matter for you? First, go to another one. Will the world collapse if you don't get the job? Then chillout. You want to present yourself from the best perspective. So instead of thinking that you might look bad, say something wrong or miss something, don't worry, nobody is perfect and nobody expects you to be perfect, know everything. Today, it's more important to be a team player, the company will teach you any specific details you need for the job.
